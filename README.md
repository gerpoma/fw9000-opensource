# FW 9000
FW 9000 is a joke bot that i made for fun

# How to setup
first, create a bot in Discord's developer hub (if it isn't obvious)

if u created the bot, copy its token, go to the end of source.js and put ur token in `tokk`

now make both logs and Downloads directories, its required

# How to run
assuming that its already setup, we can now run ``npm install``

after npm finishes installing everything, we can run ``node source.js`` to start the bot
and thats it

enjoy

btw if u have any issues u can start a new issue for that specific platform, make sure to include node js version :3
